This folder contains the game which was developed during my bachelor thesis. 

The game is an Endless Runner which can be played in a visual, audio, and haptic game mode. 

To start the game navigate to: /Builds/Windows and then x86 for a 32-bit PC and x86_64 for a 64-bit PC.
There you will find the Endless Runner.exe

The production code for the game and the menus can be found in /Assets/Scripts

To see the project as a whole you need Unity version 2020.2.2f1 and then import this folder as a new project. 

HOW TO PLAY
Navigate the menus with the keyboard arrows or the mouse. 
In the game, you need to avoid obstacles by jumping over (UP arrow) or sliding under (DOWN arrow).

In the visual mode, you will be able to see the obstacles coming towards you. 

In the audio mode, you need to listen for which obstacle it is, the jump obstacle sound is higher pitched than 
the slide obstacle, and before the obstacle you will hear a sound indicating you to act by jumping or sliding. 

The haptic mode is unplayable without the haptic device.
